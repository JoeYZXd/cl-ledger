- Figure out what LOCAL-TIME-DESIGNATOR is supposed to do and
  implement it

- Support for intervals of time.  Naggum's paper specifies that in
  timestrings, elements removed from the right produce an indeterminate
  designation.  This could easily be considered an interval, with a
  starting moment in time and a duration.  A simple duration could
  be an interval of time without a starting moment.

- Decide on microseconds or milliseconds.  Naggum's paper uses milliseconds,
  but microseconds might be more useful.  It fits into a fixnum, at least.

- Write a more flexible formatting function for times, perhaps something
  like strftime() except lispy

- PARSE-TIMESTRING works fine, but we need a more human-friendly parser that
  can handle stuff like "08/03/2006 1:54pm CST"

- Support for other notational systems than the Gregorian

- Ideally, local-time should have everything that the ruby Date class does,
  as well as the time functions in the venerable and honored clsql library.
  This may be a tall order.
