* DEFERRED Change the division logic to use rationals instead
  - State "DEFERRED"   [2007-11-25 Sun 01:39] \\
    I'm not entirely sure this is the best, because at some point the rational
    must be converted to a floating point.  By staying entirely with integers as I
    do now, I never run into FP issues.

* DONE Make all read journals be normalized
  - State "DONE"       [2007-11-25 Sun 01:44] \\
    This is now done during parsing, so that the resulting binder is never
    un-normalized.
    
    Transactions whose values were calculated during normalization can be detected
    by calling `xact-calculated-p'.  Transactions that were inserted during
    normalization (such as by automated entries) can be found by calling
    `xact-generatedp'.  In this way, the pre-normalization state of an entry can
    be determined.

* DONE Standardize initial data flow
  - State "DONE"       [2007-11-25 Sun 01:45] \\
    The canonical sequence is now:
    :SCRIPT:
    (defparameter *binder* (make-instance 'ledger:binder))
    (ledger:add-journal *binder* "path/to/journal.dat")
    (ledger:register-report *binder*)
    :END:
    There still need to be facilities for reloading all of a binder's journals if
    they've changed, etc.

  1. Create a binder
  2. Read one or more journals into the binder
     (Normalization happens at this time)
  3. Walk all transactions in the binder

* DONE Complete the CAMBL unit tests
