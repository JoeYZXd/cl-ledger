This is a very brief README, since things are just beginning and still very
much in flux.  First, this document assumes the use of SBCL for now.  Other
implementations will be tested soon.

The first thing to do is install the prerequisites.  You may do this quite
easily using asdf-install (note that if Hunchentoot gives you compilation
error on the file port-sbcl, just select the restart for ACCEPT):

  $ sbcl
  * (require 'asdf-install)
  * (push  :hunchentoot-no-ssl *features*)
  * (asdf-install:install :hunchentoot)
  * (asdf-install:install :cl-who)
  * (asdf-install:install :cl-ppcre)
  * (asdf-install:install :local-time)
  * (asdf-install:install :series)
  * (quit)

Now you need to pull all of the projects relating to Ledger.  Here's what I do
for Mercurial:

  $ hg clone http://hg.newartisans.com/ledger
  $ hg clone http://hg.newartisans.com/cambl
  $ hg clone http://hg.newartisans.com/periods
  $ hg clone http://hg.newartisans.com/red-black

The next step is to configure SBCL so it knows where to load ledger from.
Create a file called ~/.sbclrc and add these contents:

  ;; -*- lisp -*-
  
  (mapc 'require '(sb-bsd-sockets sb-posix asdf asdf-install))
  
  (dolist (project '("red-black/"
                     "cambl/"
                     "periods/"
                     "ledger/"))
    (push (merge-pathnames project "/path/to/src/")
          asdf:*central-registry*))

Make sure you change /path/to/src/ to be the directory under which you're
keeping all of the Ledger projects.  Also, be sure this pathname ends with a
slash!  In CL, directory names always end with/

Now you can run Ledger at the REPL like this:

  $ sbcl
  * (require 'asdf)
  * (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :ledger)

This compiles and loads the Ledger core, and also the textual parser package,
for parsing standard Ledger text files (other parser packages soon to come).

Once in the REPL, try out this command:

  * (ledger:register-report "/path/to/src/ledger/doc/sample.dat")

You should see a register printed representing the contents of sample.dat.
You can constrain this report using keyword modifiers:

  * (ledger:register-report "/path/to/src/ledger/doc/sample.dat"
                            :account "books")

Ledger also supports the notion of a "Last binder".  For example:

  * (ledger:read-binder "/path/to/sample.dat")
  * (ledger:register-report :account "books")

After the call to `read-binder', the variable `*last-binder*' contains the
contents of what was read.  From that point forward, if no binder or string is
passed to the reporting function, they will assume you wish to report on the
contents of `*last-binder*'.

If you prefer to use the HTTP interface, just cd to where you have Ledger
pulled and type "make".  If this works, you can quit, then type "make core" to
build a core file just for the Ledger web server.  After it's built, type
"make" to run the server using the core.  Once a core is built, Ledger should
start up in a split second.

That's it for now, expect more in this file as things progress!

p.s. For fans of the SERIES library, you can apply `scan-transactions' or
     `scan-entries' to a binder/account/journal/entry in order to produce
     a SERIES of the corresponding type.  Example:

       (collect (ledger:scan-transactions
       		 (read-binder "doc/sample.dat")))
	  => [a list of all transactions, in sequence, within sample.dat]
